## Inspiration

On average, startup founders spend 3 months communicating with VC's before actually raising capital.  This is a huge time commitment which distracts founders from building their products and managing their teams.

## What it does

Funder aims to connect startups and VC's in a quick and intuitive manner.  On one end startups sift through VC firms, while on the other VC's are presented with an assortment of 15-60 second video startup elevator pitches.

If there is a mutual interest--both parties have "right swiped" each other--a connection is made, and each party has the option to start an immediate video call (over Skype), or to schedule a time when they are available for a quick call.

## How we built it

The app runs on Android devices, and is hosted on Microsoft Azure.  We also used MongoDB for our content backend.

## Challenges we ran into

Vimeo's API gave us a ton of problems.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We went around collecting video elevator pitches from several other teams at Hack@Brown.  Any judges that wish to build our demo onto their Android devices are able to check out various pitches from the competition without leaving our table.

## What we learned

Microsoft Azure, MongoDB, Android, Material Design.

## What's next for Funder

Waiting for somebody to swipe right on us!
